            <p>I am a Sophomore at Iowa State University currently studying to obtain my Bachelor's of Science in
                Software Engineering. One of the classes I am taking this semester is COM S 319 where I am learning to
                code in HTML and CSS. By
                taking this class, I plan to build and improve my skills in web developement as a Software Engineer. On
                the side, I am a member of the Iowa State Archery Club and swim club. Along with participating in clubs,
                I also enjoy photography and painting in my own time as hobbies.</p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>This page is one of my first web pages which I coded in html.
                    This project is to develop a single Web page using only two technologies: HTML and CSS.
                    The project consists in creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as Navigation Bar. We
                    have to include text describing ourself and text describing the project. Additionally, we need to
                    include two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything related to the project
                    itself.</p>
