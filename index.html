                I am a junior Software Engineering student at Iowa State University, with a minor in General
                Business. I posess a strong foundation in software development, embedded systems, and IT
                infrastructure, with experience spanning full-stack web development, Android application
                development, and systems administration. My technical expertise includes Java, Embedded C, MySQL, Neo4j,
                JavaScript, React, Spring Boot, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.

                <p>I have worked on several notable projects, including Sketchy Business, a real-time multiplayer
                    drawing game built with WebSockets and Spring Boot, and Serpent Spotter, an interactive snake
                    identification website leveraging JavaScript, MongoDB, and React. I have also designed embedded
                    systems, such as an autonomous Mars Rover Robot, integrating C and Python to enable wireless terrain
                    mapping.</p>

                <p>In addition to software engineering, I have several years of hands-on experience in IT support and
                    device management. As a PC Technician II at Lone Star College and a Student Support Technician at
                    Iowa State University, I have managed device imaging and deployment using MECM, resolved
                    hardware/software issues, and administered enterprise systems.</p>

                Beyond academics and work, I am actively involved in the ISU Solar Car Club, Swim Club (Team Captain),
                and Archery Club. I also love bouldering (rock climbing), weightlifting, and basketball, combining my
                technical skills with my passion for teamwork and problem-solving. I am currently seeking internship
                opportunities in software engineering, where I can apply my
                technological expertise and leadership skills to real-world challenges.

            <h3>Sketchy Businessüé®üñåÔ∏è</h3>
            <i>Multiplayer Drawing & Guessing Game</i>
            <p>Sketchy Business is a real-time multiplayer drawing game where players take turns as drawers and guessers
                in
                a fast-paced, competitive environment. Guessers earn points for correct answers, while drawers are
                rewarded
                based on how many players successfully guess their sketches. The game features user sign-up/login,
                customizable usernames, and unlockable profile pictures tied to experience (EXP) earned through
                victories.
                To ensure a safe and enjoyable experience, we implemented a reporting system, allowing admins to review
                and
                address inappropriate drawings.</p>

            <h3><strong><u>Technical Highlights:</u></strong></h3>
            <b>Frontend:</b> Android Studio, Java ‚Äì Designed UI elements, background images, app art, and page layouts.
            <br><br>
            <b>Backend:</b> IntelliJ, Spring Boot ‚Äì Implemented CI/CD pipelines for automated backend deployment.
            <br><br>
            <b>Real-Time Features:</b> WebSockets for live drawing and chat functionality.
            <br><br>
            <strong>üèÜ Achievements:</strong>
            My team and I were recognized as exceptional coders and managers, securing 2nd place in our section for
            Sketchy Business. Our professor commended our technical execution, teamwork, and project management skills,
            making this project one of our proudest accomplishments!</p>

            <h3>SerpentSpotterüêçüîç</h3>
            <i>Snake Identification Website</i>
            <p>SerpentSpotter is an educational website designed to help residents of Iowa identify local snake species
                and understand their ecological importance. Whether you‚Äôre a curious hiker, a homeowner encountering a
                backyard visitor, or a wildlife enthusiast, SerpentSpotter provides the tools to confidently recognize
                and learn about the snakes in your area. The website features a comprehensive glossary with detailed
                descriptions, high-quality images, and key
                characteristics of each species‚Äîincluding appearance, habitat, behavior, and their role in the
                ecosystem. To make identification even easier, SerpentSpotter includes an interactive search function
                that filters snake species based on user-inputted characteristics, helping users match their encounters
                with the right species effortlessly.</p>

            <h3><strong><u>Technical Highlights:</u></strong></h3>
            <strong>Frontend: </strong>React, HTML, CSS ‚Äì Designed an intuitive UI with clear, informative
            visuals.<br><br>
            <strong>Backend: </strong>MongoDB, JavaScript ‚Äì Developed a structured database for storing and retrieving
            snake species
            data.<br><br>
            <strong>Search & Identification: </strong>Implemented a dynamic filtering system that allows users to input
            traits and
            receive matching results in real time.
            <br><br>
            <strong>üåü Why It Matters:</strong>
            Snakes play a crucial role in Iowa‚Äôs ecosystems, controlling pest populations and maintaining balance in the
            food chain. By educating the public and promoting awareness, SerpentSpotter helps reduce fear and
            misinformation surrounding these often-misunderstood reptiles.

            <h3>Mars Rover Applicationü§ñüì°</h3>
            <p><i>Autonomous Navigation System</i></p>
            This project is an embedded C application that transforms a Roomba into a Mars Rover, navigating
            its environment while avoiding obstacles in real-time. Using a combination of IR sensors, sonar (Ping)
            sensors, and bumper sensors, the robot triggers pre-programmed functions that analyze the sensor data and
            adjusts the robot's path. This enables it to navigate through an obstical-ridden path without human
            intervention.

            <p>Additionally, I modified a Python GUI that takes the robot's sensor data and uses it to map the terrain
                surrounding the robot. This allows the robot to be observed without physically looking at it, similar to
                the mars rover.</p>
            <h3><strong><u>Technical Highlights:</u></strong></h3>
            <strong>Languages: </strong>Embedded C, Python<br><br>
            <strong>Embedded Systems: </strong>Implemented data collection from IR, sonar, and bumper sensors to detect
            and avoid obstacles.<br><br>
            <strong>GUI & Visualization: </strong>Designed a Python-based interface for live terrain mapping and
            navigation feedback.<br><br>

            <strong>üèÜ Achievements:</strong>
            This project showcases my expertise in embedded systems, real-time processing, and human-computer
            interaction. Although it was one of my most challenging projects, I found that what I could accomplish by
            combining hardware with my programming knowledge was fascinating, as it led me to create a fully autonomous
            and interactive system.
